# INSTRUCTIONS
- as of right now you can use any accounts to login however in later versions i will most likely need the account login that is currently playing vrchat
- make sure that you put a account in login.txt if you are going to use avatar logging
- it is reccomended that you delete your vrchat cache before using the program because you might get rate limited by the api
